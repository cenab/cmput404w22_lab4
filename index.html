			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>My name is Batu ü¶æ and I am a software engineer. I graduate from University of Alberta in May, 2023. I am passionate about AI/ML, Distributed and Parallel systems, and Backend engineering. Always looking out to learn new technologies. I love implementing the new technologies I learn as impactful projects that makes people's lives easier and more enjoyable. I have experience in developing ML models, web applications, APIs, mobile apps, and desktop software. üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª</p>
            <p>As my hobbies outside of tech, I love hiking ü•æ, watching movies üçø and travelling üõ´. I enjoy learning about cultures from all around the world üåé. My favorite places I have ever been are Istanbul, Amsterdam and Rome. I also have an impressive collection of "For Dummies" booksüìö and I am on my journey to find the world's finest poutine.</p>
